Init file for neovim (0.5.0)

This is my personal init file with the following self-imposed goals:
  1. Use as few plugins as possible
  2. Utilize FZF heavily
  3. Utilize sneak for motion where other built-in motions can't get the job done as effectively
  4. Roll my own status line
  5. (For now) keep the configuration all within a single file (init.lua) and keep the loc to a minimum (currently at ~400)
  6. (For now) utilize the built-in omnifunc for completion (on-demand) vs. autocompletion as autcompletion is expensive
